Datasets
------------

We've been using the 2005 dataset from [u-go](http://www.u-go.net/gamerecords/). We started with the [badukmovies](https://badukmovies.com/pro_games) collection, but discovered that a lot of the games are missing moves.

A good list of databases is [here](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoDatabases).


TODO
-------------

Make load_counts take a list of moves at which to sample

Use new plotting function in examine_game()
