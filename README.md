Datasets
------------

We've been using the 2005 dataset from http://www.u-go.net/gamerecords/. We started with the https://badukmovies.com/pro_games collection, but discovered that a lot of the games are missing moves.


TODO
-------------

Make load_counts take a list of moves at which to sample

Use new plotting function in examine_game()
